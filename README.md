# Sales Trends Analysis for E-commerce Company Elist


# Overview
From 2019 to 2022, the total sales was ~$28M, average yearly sale revenue was ~$7M and the average order value (AOV) was $254. During the 2019-2022 period, sales in 2020 saw dramatic growth which can be attributed to the start of the pandemic. However, the total sales, average order value, and order count began to decline in 2022, highlighting the need to identify strategies to sustain the growth momentum achieved in 2020.

## Sales Trends and Growth Rates
Sales experienced significant growth from 2019 to 2020 with revenue increasing from ~$3.9M to ~$10.2M. However, this was not sustained as sales declined steadily, falling to ~$4.9M by 2022. Similarly, this can also be seen in the average order value (AOV), which peaked at $300 in 2020 but decreased to $230 in 2022. 2020 experienced the biggest growth rate across total sales revenue, AOV, and number of sales. Although 2021 experienced positive growth in the number of sales, the total sales revenue decreased by 10% as people purchased items that were less expensive by 15% than in 2020.

## Product Trends

From 2019 to 2020, the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple AirPods, MacBook Air, and ThinkPad laptops all experienced a sharp increase in sales. The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor continued to grow slightly from 2020 to 2021, while the Apple AirPods, MacBook Air, and ThinkPad saw a decline in sales after 2020. In contrast, the Apple iPhone, Bose SoundSport Headphones, Samsung Charging Cable Pack, and Samsung Webcam maintained consistently low sales with minor fluctuations throughout 2019 to 2022.

## Loyalty Program
From 2019 to 2021, the non-loyalty program customers were performing better when compared to the loyalty program customers, with a noticeably higher AOV    ($233–$345 vs. $207–$249). However, in 2022, the AOV for loyalty program customers rose to $245 while the non-loyalty program customers dropped to $214, creating a $30 increase over the non-loyalty program customers. Additionally, there has been an increasingly upward trend in order count for the loyalty program customers over the years, so I recommend keeping the loyalty program.

## Refund Rates
Refund rates were highest for Apple Airpods in 2020 with 1,853 headphones refunded at 9% compared to 5% in 2019 and 4% in 2021. The lowest refund rates were in 2022 at 0%, but this may be a date incompleteness issue, so I plan to follow up to understand why the refunds appear non-existent. 

## Recommendations

### Products:
Since current sales are driven primarily by monitors, headphones, and laptops, it is recommended to focus on similar product categories to strengthen sales and market reach. If cuts are necessary, discontinuing Bose headphones, Samsung product lines, and the Apple iPhone should be considered.

### Loyalty Program:
It is recommended that the loyalty program be continued, as there has been an increase in orders contributing to higher sales. The program also generates valuable data on customer purchasing behavior, which can inform future sales strategies.
